        This is my first website where you get the chance to get to know me. My
        name is Alma Sikiric. I am 21 years old. Currently, I am studying
        Graphic Design and web development. I'm intrigued by everything I have
        learnt so far and continue to learn everyday. From logos and branding,
        to programming so on and so forth. My interests to graphic design begun
        as clothing. I really enjoy styling clothes and learning about what fits
        well together for instance: color-combinations, textures, sizing etc.
